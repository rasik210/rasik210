### Namaste! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rasik. I'm a programmer. I'm an eternal learner.

This default repository contains code for deploying a plain HTML file into Azure web app. This is a very simple web application containing just one HTML web page. Here you can learn, how to setup end to end GitHub's CI/CD DevOps pipeline for a web application. 

Here are the steps that you can follow to run this code in Azure environment:
- Open Azure portal. Now, create an Azure web app using "Node-20-lts" as runtime stack and "Linux" as target operating system.
- Name of Azure web app above will have to be updated in ".github\workflows\main_tictactoebharat.yml" file in the code base.
- Commit the changes in ".github\workflows\main_tictactoereact.yml" file and push the changes to your GitHub repository to trigger CI/CD workflow.
- Once the CI/CD execution completes, go to the web app on the Azure portal. Go to "Overview" section in left pane. Click the link below the "Default domain" field in the right pane.
- Now view the HTML page in a new browser tab that has opened.

**Caution**: This code repository or the CI/CD pipeline will not work if you use Node runtime stack targeting Windows operating system.
